## Day 1

### Javascript

Reminder : don't forget to save the input in the file.txt ..

For the second part, I chosed to filter the tab twice and to find the max three times
Sorting the tab would have been much more elegant but not necessarily more efficient, it depends on the size of the input.

## Day 2

### Javascript

Nothing to report except my code isn't elegant

## Day 3

### Javascript

Using reducing is not obvious, I finally chosed to make a loop to treat my input ... I'm looking to change that in the next few days.
But reducing seems to be powerful !

## Day 4

### Javascript 

Just one thing : don't forget to map after splitting a string
Execpt that nothing to report

## Day 5

### Javascript

Still not using .reduce. First part was fun.

WARNING : copy by reference IS NOT deep copy !!
I believed I made a deep copy of an array but that wasn't the case.

## Day 6

### Javascript

I've been catching up.
Nothing to report for part one.

Some difficulties with disclosures and sort() in the second part

## Week 2-3

Beaucoup de difficulté à modéliser les problèmes et à utiliser les bonnes structures de données ... Même si j'ai passé du temps à débuguer certains problèmes étaient fun !
