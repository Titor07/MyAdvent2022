## Day 1

### Javascript

Reminder : don't forget to save the input in the file.txt ..

For the second part, I chosed to filter the tab twice and to find the max three times
Sorting the tab would have been much more elegant but not necessarily more efficient, it depends on the size of the input.

## Day 2

### Javascript

Nothing to report except my code isn't elegant

## Day 3

### Javascript

part two is coming soon
Reduce is cool !
